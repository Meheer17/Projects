<br><br>

<ul>
  <li><a href="">Quote Machine</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Markdown Previwer</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Drum Machine</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Calculator</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Pomodoro Clock</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Location Finder</a></li>
</ul>
<br><br>
I would try my best to keep this updated with all the new projects i make.
<br><br>
Pls feel free to use this to make your own website.<br>
All the JavaScript codes is easy to understand.<br>
The css might be cramped up will soon try to fix these issues.<br>
